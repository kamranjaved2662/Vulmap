Impact:
Any User can be lured in to click on whats look like a functionality of the website but is actually an attackers frame button containing some malicious javascript code or redirection code leading the user to a vulnerable site . And as the vulnerability persists even after the user is logged in which makes it even more sever.

Suggested Fix:
Add an iframe destroyer in the page headers.

Please let me know if any more info needed !
